# Abandon All Ships - Paradise

Close your eyes
We're suspended in time
Open up the sky and let me rise, you are mine
Give me a sign
Make the stars align
Let them shine

Close your eyes
We're suspended in time
Open up the sky
Give me a sign
Make the stars align
Let them shine

We're suspended in time

There's a paradise for me and you
My paradise is built for two
It's hard to find where does it hide
All along it was by my side

Follow your heart and it lead you there
Cause paradise is everywhere
Take my hand it's yours to hold
Take my heart it's made of gold

Where do I start?
Are you sent from above
Set fire to my heart
I want to burn in your love
Let me feel the winter turn to spring
Lift my body up I want to feel your love again

Close your eyes
Were suspended in time
Open up the sky
Give me a sign
Make the star align
Let them shine
Let them shine
Let them shine

The wind won't guide you
To your distinction
You'll never follow through
Sin is your only salvation

The wind won't guide you
To your distinction
You'll never follow through
Sin is your only salvation

There's a paradise for me and you
My paradise is built for two
Its hard to find where does it hide
All along it was by my side

Follow your heart and it lead you there
Cause paradise is everywhere
Take my hand it's yours to hold
Take my heart it's made of gold

Close your eyes
Were suspended in time
Open up the sky
Give me a sign
Make the star align
Let them shine
