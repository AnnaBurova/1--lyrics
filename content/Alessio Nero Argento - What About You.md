# Alessio Nero Argento - What About You?

```
When someone needs to rebuilt his future
When everyday starts a different world
Someone decides to be only a picture
Some people say that life is so strong

I don't wanna hear them anymore
If noone tries to react
Everything remains lost
I don't wanna feel this anymore
If noone tries to forget
We will see nothin' more

Will you wake up here?
If every morning starts another day with no future
Will you fall down here?
To the grownd, maybe lower
I'm askin' to your soul:
What about you?

When someone needs to become a master
When something real seems to kill the truth
Human mistake generates some pressure
Some people cry, smoke and feel confuse

I don't wanna see this anymore
If everyone turns the back
Everything becomes stone
I don't wanna see you insicure
If noone tries to come back
We will see something more

Will you wake up here?
If every morning starts another day with no future
Will you fall down here?
To the grownd, maybe lower
I'm askin' to your soul:

Hear me now
The more you live in silence, the less you keep control
The only thing to do
Is be less like people and be more like you
Is be less like people and be more like you
Is be less like people and be more like you
Is be less like people and be more like you
Is be less like people and be more like you

I'm askin'
Will you wake up here?
If every morning starts another day with no future
And I'm askin'
Will you fall down here?
To the grownd, maybe lower
I'm askin' to your soul:
What about

Will you wake up here?
If every morning starts another day with no future
Will you fall down here?
To the grownd, maybe lower
I'm askin' to your soul:
What about

Will you wake up here?
If every morning starts another day with no future
Will you fall down here?
To the grownd, maybe lower
I'm askin' to your soul:
What about you?
