# 3OH!3 - Bang Bang

```
Faster than a bullet train,
She's like bang bang,
You won't even feel the pain,
She's like bang bang
[x2]

You read that I was bad news before you even met me.
You know the dudes I hang with that aint exactly friendly.
99 bottles on the wall until they empty.
You were such a plain Jane, now you go bang bang.

It was only one kiss, one night, but I know you'll never let it slide.
All I got is one shot, to fix this.
And you know I'm gonna make it right.

So put your hands in the air
Hands in the air
Hands in the air
Shes gonna shoot
[x2]

She's got her finger on the trigger like bang bang
And I'm right there in the middle like bang bang.

Put your hands in the air
Hands in the air
Hands in the air
She's gonna shoot

I had 30 missed calls and dirty mix drinks
When you found me getting in flirting with the girl on the sink
Call me David Copperfield,
Poof, gone before you blink
And you can play the blame game
I think it goes bang bang

It was only one kiss, one night,
But I know you'll never let it slide
All I got is one shot to fix this
And you know I'm gonna make it right

So put your hands in the air,
Hands in the air,
Hands in the air,
She's gonna shoot.
[x2]

She's got her finger on the trigger like bang bang
And they're right there in the middle like bang bang

So put your hands in the air,
Hands in the air,
Hands in the air,
She's gonna shoot.

Faster than a bullet train,
She's like bang bang
You won't even feel the pain
She's like bang bang
[x4]

So put your hands in the air,
Hands in the air,
Hands in the air,
She's gonna shoot.
[x2]

She's got her finger on the trigger like bang bang
And they're right there in the middle like bang bang

So put your hands in the air,
Hands in the air,
Hands in the air,
She's gonna shoot.
