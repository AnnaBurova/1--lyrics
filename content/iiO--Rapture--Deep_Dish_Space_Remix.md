# iiO - Rapture (Deep Dish Space Remix)

```
The night I laid my eyes on you
Felt everything around me move
Got nervous when you looked my way
But you knew all the words to say

Then your love slowly moved right in
All this time, oh my love where you been

I'm mesmerized in every way
You keep me in a state of daze
You're kisses make my skin feel weak
I'm always melting in your heat

Then your love slowly moved right in
All this time, oh my love where you been

Mi amore, don't you know
My love, I want you so
Sugar, you make my soul complete
Rapture tastes so sweet

Mi amore, don't you know
My love, I want you so
Sugar, you make my soul complete
Rapture tastes so sweet

I'm mesmerized in every way
You keep me in a state of daze
You're kisses make my skin feel weak
I'm always melting in your heat

Then I soar like a bird in the wind
Oh, I glide as I'm flying through heaven

Mi amore, don't you know
My love, I want you so
Sugar, you make my soul complete
Rapture tastes so sweet

Mi amore, don't you know
My love, I want you so
Sugar, you make my soul complete
Rapture tastes so sweet

Mi amore, don't you know
My love, I want you so
Sugar, you make my soul complete
Rapture tastes so sweet

Mi amore, don't you know
My love, I want you so, yeah
Sugar, you make my soul complete
Rapture tastes so sweet

Mi amore, don't you know
My love, I want you so
Sugar, you make my soul complete
Rapture tastes so sweet

Mi amore, don't you know
My love, I want you so
