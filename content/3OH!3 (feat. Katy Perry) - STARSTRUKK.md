# 3OH!3 (feat. Katy Perry) - STARSTRUKK

```
Nice legs, Daisy Dukes,
Makes a man go (whistles),
That's the way they all come through like (whistles),
Low-cut, see-through shirts that make ya (whistles),
That's the way she come through like (whistles),

Cause I just set them up,
Just set them up,
Just set them up
(to knock them down),
Cause I just set them up,
Just set them up,
Just set them up,
To knock them down

I think I should know how to make love to something innocent
Without leaving my fingerprints out,
Now, l-o-v-e's just another word I never learned to pronounce,
How do I say I'm sorry 'cause the word is never gonna come out,
Now, L-o-v-e's just another word I never learned to pronounce

Tight jeans, double D's makin' me go (whistles),
All the people on the street know (whistles),
Iced out, lit-up make the kids go (whistles),
All the people on the street know (whistles),

Cause I just set them up,
Just set them up,
Just set them up
(to knock them down),
Cause I just set them up,
Just set them up,
Just set them up,
To knock them down

I think I should know how to make love to something innocent
Without leaving my fingerprints out,
Now, l-o-v-e's just another word I never learned to pronounce,
How do I say I'm sorry 'cause the word is never gonna come out,
Now, L-o-v-e's just another word I never learned to pronounce

You know that type of sh-t just don't work on me
Whistling and trying to flirt with me
Don't take it personally 'cause we were never in love

It doesn't really matter who you say you are
Singing at the window of your car
Find another girl across the bar 'cause L.O.V.E's not what this was

I think I should know, (oh ohh)
how, (oh ohh) to make love to something innocent without leaving my fingerprints out, (oh ohh)
Now, (oh ohh) L-O-V-E's just another word i never learned to pronounce, (oh ohh)
How, (oh ohh) do I say I'm sorry cause the word is never gonna come out, (oh ohh)
Now, (oh ohh) L.O.V.E's just another word I never learned to pronounce.
